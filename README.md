# CHAMACOSconnectivity
This work has been accepted in Neurotoxiology (2024).

chamacos_fc_Eric.m: this is the original code I got from Eric.

chamacos_fc_preprocessing.m: calculate functional connectivity values from the fNIRS data.

chamacos_fc_modeling.m: constructing correaltion models between connectivity and DAP data.

Connectivity.m: this is a class that contains all the methodologies/functions used in chamacos_fc_modeling.m

connectivity.R: This is a R code file, where we visualize the significant association between connectivity and DAP data. We also set up a mediation model here among connectivity, DAP, and behavioral data.
